EasyStatus is a simple Menu Bar item that show the current connection status of the Vodafone EasyBox 803.
The implemenation is quite crude and is based heavily on parsing the javascript var lists used by the router interface.

## Supported Devices
Currently only the EasyBox 803A is supported and nothing more is planned.
